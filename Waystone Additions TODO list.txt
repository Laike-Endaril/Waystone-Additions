Implement block protection

Change "can only be renamed by whoever placed them" to "can only be renamed by their owner"

Add renders for protected zones

Add a way to lay siege to a waystone (from outside the block and pvp protection zones; disallow this feature inside said zones)...
...do this by placing other waystones in a certain pattern around the one you're trying to take over
...all waystones in the assimilation formation must have the same owner

Add option for naturally generating waystones in other dimensions

Add chameleon waystones (take on the texture of the block below them)

Add option for whether waystones drop their item upon being broken

Add grouped waystones (only link to waystones in the same group; group defined by which runes are lit)

Add entry stones (can teleport from but not to) and exit stones (can teleport to but not from)

Add waystone -> waystone teleportation chargeup, damage interruption, and other settings similar to those for the warp stone

Option for whether you select your destination before or after chargeup
Option for whether the waystone being teleported to shows a particle effect when someone is charging up to teleport to it (choice before chargeup must be set to true)

Add corrupted waystones (look like normal waystones with a slight difference, never lit, instantly teleport you somewhere when right clicked)
...corrupted waystone dimension directions (array of from -> to dimension ids; if teleporting to dimension with different travel multiplier, account for it)
...corrupted waystone inner teleport radius
...corrupted waystone outer teleport radius

Fix waystones being detected as unactivated by client after someone else renames them (Waystones core bug)
