Implement existing config options...
...keep world.loadedTileEntities in mind

Add renders for protected zones

Add a way to lay siege to a waystone (from outside the block and pvp protection zones; disallow this feature inside said zones)...
...do this by placing other waystones in a certain pattern around the one you're trying to take over
...all waystones in the assimilation formation must have the same owner

Fix waystones being detected as unactivated by client after someone else renames them (Waystones core bug)...
...does this only happen on integrated server, or does it also happen on dedicated?
